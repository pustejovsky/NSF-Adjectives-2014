\section*{Data Management Plan}

All project results will be released to the general public. Theoretical findings will be published in relevant conferences and journals. All corpora, annotations, and associated {\sc cdi}s will be made available and open to the community, first through our website and then through distribution by the LDC. All annotation results and  
source code generated to 
analyze the differences  between annotation phases  will at all times be accessible through the project's GitHub repository and will be released under an Apache 2.0 license. 

%The main drive of the project is  to identify the patterns of inference associated with three major classes of adjectives. By then comparing the expert annotation corpus with the judgments made by MTurkers, we hope to identify and isolate the contextual factors that contribute to the differential judgments, when they occur.
